# HW2

Coded and compiled in Visual Studio 2017. My problem 4 is a very rough approximation of a hand making the UH handsign with a triforce on the back to fulfill the manual placement of a triangle requirement. 

Property Pages:
Additional Include Directories: $(SolutionDir)Dependencies\include
With the downloaded glut bin, include and lib files inside the Dependencies folder

Linked Libraries:
freeglut.lib;kernel32.lib;user32.lib;gdi32.lib;winspool.lib;comdlg32.lib;advapi32.lib;shell32.lib;ole32.lib;oleaut32.lib;uuid.lib;odbc32.lib;odbccp32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)

The freeglut.dll files also must be present in the same folder as the .exe file for the program to work.
